Frequency Analysis

A cryptanalysis method that uses how often letters appear in a language to break ciphers.
In English, some letters show up far more than others. By matching ciphertext letter frequencies to English ones, you can guess the substitution.

Most common English letters (in order):
E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C … (least common: Q, Z, X, J)
